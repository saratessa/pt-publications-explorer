## What this is

The **Publications Explorer** is a searchable, filterable dashboard of research relevant to Precision Teaching. You can filter by year, publication type, focus area, search by author/title keywords, sort columns, and open original sources via the **Link** column.

## Why this exists

To make it **faster and easier for Precision Teachers** to find and use available research.

## What you can do here

-   **Filter** by year, type, and focus area\
-   **Search** by author/title/keywords (table search box)\
-   **Sort** any column\
-   **Download** your filtered results (Copy/CSV/Excel/Print buttons)\
-   **Jump to sources** using the "open" column\
-   **Watch trend graphs update live** as you filter

## Help keep it accurate

This explorer was built and is updated by one person. I’ve taken care and attention, but it’s a large project and **errors are possible**. If you notice:

\- a **missing paper**,\
- a **focus area label** that doesn’t fit, or\
- a **broken/missing link**,\
please email [**spalos\@celeration.org**](mailto:spalos@celeration.org).

*Thanks for helping improve this resource for the PT community!*
